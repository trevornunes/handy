Atari Lynx Emulator 'Handy'

This is a port of Atari Lynx emulator located at http://handy.sourceforge.net

You'll need both rom games and a bootrom image. atariage.com is an awesome Atari site so check out the Lynx section ...

http://www.atariage.com/software_search.html?SystemID=LYNX

Create misc/roms/lynx on your Playbook/BB10 if it's not automatically created...

Inside here we need the lynxboot.img file otherwise no games can be loaded.

Tap top left corner of screen to iterate through rom list.  A UI driven selector will come later, for now the BPS dialogs either flat out don't work on BB10 or look funny with SDL.
